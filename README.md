# Elevator Simulation

This is a simple elevator simulation written in Python. The program models the behavior of an elevator in a building with multiple floors, allowing users to request floors and simulating the elevator's movement.

## Features

- Request floors within the building's range.
- The elevator processes requests in ascending order.
- Simulates the elevator's movement and current state.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ethan-Way/Python-Elevator.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Python-Elevator

3. Run the elevator simulation:

   ```bash
   python Simulation.py
