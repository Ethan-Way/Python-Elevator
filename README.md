# Elevator Simulation

This is a simple elevator simulation written in Python. The program assumes the behavior of a single elevator in a building with a static number of floors, no weight limit, and immediate response time.

## Features

- Request floors within the building's range.
- The elevator processes requests in ascending order.
- Simulates the elevator's movement and current state.

## Potential Features not implemented

- Mechanism to track weight and or number of passangers to not go over the elevator's capacity.
- States like "doors opening", "maintenance mode", "emergency".
- Emergency features like a fire alarm or emergency stop button.
- Allow the elevator to handle requests dynamically instead of starting at the bottom floor and going in ascending order.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ethan-Way/Python-Elevator.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Python-Elevator

3. Run the elevator simulation:

   ```bash
   python Simulation.py
